# ICCS
Balsa Terzic's ICCS code snippets. These are code snippets obtained from Kirsten.

The code here is probably not complete, it is a python code for making ICS spectra plots.

An updated version of the code is 3DICCS. 

Balsa doesn't currently let outside users independently run the code.

The code is based on PRSTAB 12, 062801 (2009) and is used in Geoff Krafft's papers such as PRAB 21, 030701 (2018).

__Changelog__

An example config.in file from Balsa, also file with the CBETA 0.5% bandwidth parameters.

A Mathematica parser to convert Tao bunch tracking data at the IP to the momentum distribution used by ICCS. This also includes space for verification of the data through plotting of x-px phase space, which can be compared to a Tao custom plot of the same.

This is some of the code of an older version of Balsa Terzic et al's ICCS code used to create spectra plots for inverse Compton scattering.
I am not to use this without permission of the authors.
I believe an example input file is missing.
I should be able to recreate how a spectra is made in ICCS from this code.
